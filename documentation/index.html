<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
<h2 id="about-the-project">About The Project</h2>
<img src="readme-assets/nextaskdemo.gif" alt="screenshot">

<p>I love the concept of productivity.  Task management to time is like budgeting to money; it helps you save and spend your resources.  There are a lot of great task management apps out there.  However, I found that there was room for an app that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Helped you focus on the most impactful tasks first</li>
<li>Helped you schedule  your tasks more effectively</li>
<li>Helped you see the metrics that mattered at a glance</li>
</ul>
<p>This project is an attempt to fulfill these needs.  It&#39;s inspired by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_management#The_Eisenhower_Method">Eisenhower Matrix method</a>, the &quot;Hardest task first&quot; mindset/method, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeblocking">&quot;Time-Blocking&quot;</a>. </p>
<p>With Queue-D, when you create a task, you must choose the Importance, Difficulty, and Urgency.</p>
<img src="readme-assets/nextask-matrix.png" alt="task-choice">

<ul>
<li>Importance: This is a measurement based on your peception of the gravity of such a task; How serious
is it that you get this task done TODAY? </li>
<li>Difficulty: This is a measurement based on how involved you feel  you will be in this task or how draining
the task will be on your energy, time or patience.</li>
<li>Urgency: This is a measurement taking into account the timing of this task&#39;s completion in relation to other tasks.  Do you need to get this done quickly or can it wait?</li>
</ul>
<p>As you can see from the screenshot above, these questiosn are presented in a brief manner and unimposing interface.  With a brief moment, an additional step of intentionality when &#39;jotting&#39; this task on your list; you give the app enough information to prioritize the task on your &#39;queue&#39;.  </p>
<p>Tasks will arrange themselves vertically on your queue based on a summation of importance, difficulty, and urgency; the Most Urgent, the Most Difficult, and the Most Important will &#39;bubble&#39; to the top.  With that being said, you will work from the top to the bottom as you complete your tasks, assured that you are handling the most impactful tasks FIRST.</p>
<p>You may notice that based on the level of &#39;Importance&#39;, &#39;Difficulty&#39;, and &#39;Urgency&#39;, the taks on the queue will vary in gradation of orange and thickness (height).  This helps identify tasks you need to hit in priority.</p>
<h3 id="what-if-i-dont-get-to-a-task">What if I don&#39;t get to a task?</h3>
<p>Another thing that affects the prioritization of a task is the duration of existence.  Naturally, a task that you don&#39;t get to over a duration of days would increase in priority; you can only procrastinate so much.  To reflect this, that task will eventually &quot;bubble up&quot; in priority, every day it remains on the queue.  No more losing track!</p>
<p>By the way, are you trying to truncate your work day?  Why should work the tradition 8 hours/day.  You can set how many hours you want to work per day.  Based on this setting, and the amount of time you estimate per task, Queue-D will load the queue as much as you day will allow.  Any additional tasks you create beyond your daily limit, will overflow until the next day.</p>
<h3 id="need-reminders">Need reminders?</h3>
<p>Timeblocking allows you to use your calendar with task management.  By using the time-blocking feature you can integrate with your Google Calendar (based on the Google account  you signed in with).  The tasks will show up on your G-Cal based on the same order and color gradation.  Now you can take advantage of whatever defaults and settings you have set with your Google calendar (notifications, sharing, etc.)</p>
<h3 id="additional-usage">Additional Usage</h3>
<h4 id="goal-based-tasks">Goal-Based Tasks</h4>
<p>Sometimes you have Goal-based tasks that are interspersed between simple ad-hoc tasks tha occur from day to day.  These goal-based tasks have a more long-term meaning, however usually, need to relate to your &#39;one off&#39; tasks.  In line with that, you can &#39;reverse-engineer&#39; a goal down to a milestone and then to a task with Queue-D; these tasks will be included on your day to day queue accordingly.</p>

<h4 id="metrics">Metrics</h4>
<p>Have you ever wondered what tasks you tend to shy away from completing vs. the ones you hurry to complete?
What are your most productive times in day?</p>
<p>Having this insight will inform your future decisions!  Check out the &#39;Metrics&#39; section.</p>

<!-- ROADMAP -->
<h2 id="roadmap">Roadmap</h2>
<p>*It would be great to further flesh out the &#39;Metrics&#39; section, certaintly additonal information can be extracted from the data to benefit our productivity.</p>
<p>*General UX is an ongoing project.</p>
<p>*Testing is being conduced on task completion gamification and goal-based tasks.</p>
<p>See the <a href="https://github.com/kevinmilly/QueueD/issues">open issues</a> for a list of proposed features (and known issues).</p>
